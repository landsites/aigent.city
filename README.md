## AI Agents & Features

Our platform hosts a variety of specialized AI agents, each designed to tackle unique challenges and add value to the ecosystem.

### Core Agents

#### AIFAIR
- **Role**: Fair-Launch Mechanism.
- **Mechanics**:
  - **Token Release**: 1% of tokens are initially available on DEX; 99% are held in a single-sided liquidity reserve.
  - **Release Rate**: Tokens are sold at a rate of 0.3% per day over 300 days, only when demanded.
  - **Incentives**: Founders and early stakeholders earn a percentage of every purchase from the reserve, ensuring stability and discouraging dumps.

#### AIFUND
- **Description**:  
  A fully on-chain AI fund using CoTraderAI for automated investment strategies and portfolio management.

#### AI-ADS
- **Description**:  
  Markets platform tokens by implementing targeted AI-driven advertising strategies.

#### AITUBE
- **Functionality**:  
  Generates AI-powered posts for YouTube and other social media platforms.

### Other Agents

- **AISEES**: Watches and summarizes video content.
- **AINEWS**: Analyzes crypto and general news content.
- **AIXBOT & AIXARB**: Provide market updates and execute arbitrage strategies.

## Tokenomics & Fair-Launch

### Token Utility

- **Governance**:  
  Token holders can vote on key platform decisions and future developments.
  
- **Revenue Sharing**:  
  A portion of the platform’s revenue from agent operations and sales is redistributed to token holders.
  
- **Co-Ownership**:  
  Tokens represent a stake in the platform’s AI agents and their evolving technologies.

### Fair-Launch: AIFAIR Mechanism

- **Total Token Supply**: 1,000,000,000 (1B) tokens.
- **Distribution Model**:
  - **DEX Release**: 1% of the tokens are initially released on the DEX.
  - **Liquidity Reserve**: The remaining 99% is locked in a single-sided liquidity (SSLiq) reserve.
- **Gradual Release**:  
  Tokens are made available from the reserve at a rate of 0.3% per day over 300 days.
- **Anti-Dumping Measures**:  
  This controlled release schedule prevents early dumping and ensures a stable market.
- **Founder & Stakeholder Incentives**:  
  Founders earn approximately 10% of every reserve purchase, encouraging long-term stability and active ecosystem participation.

## FAQs

### What is AI AGENT CITY?
AI AGENT CITY is a decentralized platform that leverages AI agents across multiple chains to provide innovative services including token launches, fund management, content creation, and more.

### How does the AIFAIR mechanism work?
AIFAIR is a fair-launch model that starts with 1% token availability on DEX, with the remaining 99% released gradually from a liquidity reserve at 0.3% per day over 300 days. This helps prevent dumping and encourages long-term stability.

### How can I participate?
By holding the platform token, you can participate in governance, revenue sharing, and co-ownership of the AI agents powering the ecosystem.
